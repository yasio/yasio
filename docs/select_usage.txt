DESCRIPTION
       select() and pselect() allow a program to monitor multiple file descriptors, waiting until one or more of the file descriptors become "ready" for some class of I/O operation (e.g., input
       possible).  A file descriptor is considered ready if it is possible to perform a corresponding I/O operation (e.g., read(2) without blocking, or a sufficiently small write(2)).

       The operation of select() and pselect() is identical, other than these three differences:

       (i)    select() uses a timeout that is a struct timeval (with seconds and microseconds), while pselect() uses a struct timespec (with seconds and nanoseconds).

       (ii)   select() may update the timeout argument to indicate how much time was left.  pselect() does not change this argument.

       (iii)  select() has no sigmask argument, and behaves as pselect() called with NULL sigmask.

       Three independent sets of file descriptors are watched.  Those listed in readfds will be watched to see if characters become available for reading (more precisely, to see if a read  will
       not  block;  in  particular,  a  file  descriptor  is also ready on end-of-file), those in writefds will be watched to see if space is available for write (though a large write may still
       block), and those in exceptfds will be watched for exceptions.  On exit, the sets are modified in place to indicate which file descriptors actually changed status.   Each  of  the  three
       file descriptor sets may be specified as NULL if no file descriptors are to be watched for the corresponding class of events.

       Four  macros are provided to manipulate the sets.  FD_ZERO() clears a set.  FD_SET() and FD_CLR() respectively add and remove a given file descriptor from a set.  FD_ISSET() tests to see
       if a file descriptor is part of the set; this is useful after select() returns.

       nfds is the highest-numbered file descriptor in any of the three sets, plus 1.

       The timeout argument specifies the interval that select() should block waiting for a file descriptor to become ready.  The call will block until either:

       *  a file descriptor becomes ready;

       *  the call is interrupted by a signal handler; or

       *  the timeout expires.

       Note that the timeout interval will be rounded up to the system clock granularity, and kernel scheduling delays mean that the blocking interval may overrun by a small  amount.   If  both
       fields of the timeval structure are zero, then select() returns immediately.  (This is useful for polling.)  If timeout is NULL (no timeout), select() can block indefinitely.

       sigmask  is  a  pointer  to  a  signal mask (see sigprocmask(2)); if it is not NULL, then pselect() first replaces the current signal mask by the one pointed to by sigmask, then does the
       "select" function, and then restores the original signal mask.

       Other than the difference in the precision of the timeout argument, the following pselect() call:

           ready = pselect(nfds, &readfds, &writefds, &exceptfds,
                           timeout, &sigmask);

       is equivalent to atomically executing the following calls:

           sigset_t origmask;

           pthread_sigmask(SIG_SETMASK, &sigmask, &origmask);
           ready = select(nfds, &readfds, &writefds, &exceptfds, timeout);
           pthread_sigmask(SIG_SETMASK, &origmask, NULL);

       The reason that pselect() is needed is that if one wants to wait for either a signal or for a file descriptor to become ready, then an atomic test is needed to prevent  race  conditions.
       (Suppose  the  signal handler sets a global flag and returns.  Then a test of this global flag followed by a call of select() could hang indefinitely if the signal arrived just after the
       test but just before the call.  By contrast, pselect() allows one to first block signals, handle the signals that have come in, then call pselect() with the desired sigmask, avoiding the
       race.)

   The timeout
       The time structures involved are defined in <sys/time.h> and look like

           struct timeval {
               long    tv_sec;         /* seconds */
               long    tv_usec;        /* microseconds */
           };

       and

           struct timespec {
               long    tv_sec;         /* seconds */
               long    tv_nsec;        /* nanoseconds */
           };

       (However, see below on the POSIX.1-2001 versions.)

       Some code calls select() with all three sets empty, nfds zero, and a non-NULL timeout as a fairly portable way to sleep with subsecond precision.

       On  Linux,  select()  modifies  timeout to reflect the amount of time not slept; most other implementations do not do this.  (POSIX.1-2001 permits either behavior.)  This causes problems
       both when Linux code which reads timeout is ported to other operating systems, and when code is ported to Linux that reuses a struct timeval for multiple  select()s  in  a  loop  without
       reinitializing it.  Consider timeout to be undefined after select() returns.

RETURN VALUE
       On  success,  select()  and  pselect()  return  the number of file descriptors contained in the three returned descriptor sets (that is, the total number of bits that are set in readfds,
       writefds, exceptfds) which may be zero if the timeout expires before anything interesting happens.  On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error; the file  descriptor
       sets are unmodified, and timeout becomes undefined.

ERRORS
       EBADF  An invalid file descriptor was given in one of the sets.  (Perhaps a file descriptor that was already closed, or one on which an error has occurred.)

       EINTR  A signal was caught; see signal(7).

       EINVAL nfds is negative or the value contained within timeout is invalid.

       ENOMEM unable to allocate memory for internal tables.

VERSIONS
       pselect() was added to Linux in kernel 2.6.16.  Prior to this, pselect() was emulated in glibc (but see BUGS).

CONFORMING TO
       select()  conforms  to  POSIX.1-2001 and 4.4BSD (select() first appeared in 4.2BSD).  Generally portable to/from non-BSD systems supporting clones of the BSD socket layer (including Sys‐
       tem V variants).  However, note that the System V variant typically sets the timeout variable before exit, but the BSD variant does not.

       pselect() is defined in POSIX.1g, and in POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       An fd_set is a fixed size buffer.  Executing FD_CLR() or FD_SET() with a value of fd that is negative or is equal to or larger than FD_SETSIZE will result in undefined  behavior.   More‐
       over, POSIX requires fd to be a valid file descriptor.

       Concerning  the  types  involved,  the classical situation is that the two fields of a timeval structure are typed as long (as shown above), and the structure is defined in <sys/time.h>.
       The POSIX.1-2001 situation is

           struct timeval {
               time_t         tv_sec;     /* seconds */
               suseconds_t    tv_usec;    /* microseconds */
           };

       where the structure is defined in <sys/select.h> and the data types time_t and suseconds_t are defined in <sys/types.h>.

       Concerning prototypes, the classical situation is that one should include <time.h> for select().  The POSIX.1-2001 situation is that one should include <sys/select.h>  for  select()  and
       pselect().

       Under  glibc  2.0, <sys/select.h> gives the wrong prototype for pselect().  Under glibc 2.1 to 2.2.1, it gives pselect() when _GNU_SOURCE is defined.  Since glibc 2.2.2, the requirements
       are as shown in the SYNOPSIS.

   Multithreaded applications
       If a file descriptor being monitored by select() is closed in another thread, the result is unspecified.  On some UNIX systems, select() unblocks and returns, with an indication that the
       file descriptor is ready (a subsequent I/O operation will likely fail with an error, unless another the file descriptor reopened between the time select() returned and the I/O operations
       was performed).  On Linux (and some other systems), closing the file descriptor in another thread has no effect on select().  In summary, any application  that  relies  on  a  particular
       behavior in this scenario must be considered buggy.

   C library/kernel ABI differences
       The  pselect() interface described in this page is implemented by glibc.  The underlying Linux system call is named pselect6().  This system call has somewhat different behavior from the
       glibc wrapper function.

       The Linux pselect6() system call modifies its timeout argument.  However, the glibc wrapper function hides this behavior by using a local variable for the timeout argument that is passed
       to the system call.  Thus, the glibc pselect() function does not modify its timeout argument; this is the behavior required by POSIX.1-2001.

       The final argument of the pselect6() system call is not a sigset_t * pointer, but is instead a structure of the form:

           struct {
               const sigset_t *ss;     /* Pointer to signal set */
               size_t          ss_len; /* Size (in bytes) of object pointed
                                          to by 'ss' */
           };

       This  allows  the  system  call  to obtain both a pointer to the signal set and its size, while allowing for the fact that most architectures support a maximum of 6 arguments to a system
       call.

BUGS
       Glibc 2.0 provided a version of pselect() that did not take a sigmask argument.

       Starting with version 2.1, glibc provided an emulation of pselect() that was implemented using sigprocmask(2) and select().  This implementation remained vulnerable to the very race con‐
       dition that pselect() was designed to prevent.  Modern versions of glibc use the (race-free) pselect() system call on kernels where it is provided.

       On systems that lack pselect(), reliable (and more portable) signal trapping can be achieved using the self-pipe trick.  In this technique, a signal handler writes a byte to a pipe whose
       other end is monitored by select() in the main program.  (To avoid possibly blocking when writing to a pipe that may be full or reading from a pipe that may be empty, nonblocking I/O  is
       used when reading from and writing to the pipe.)

       Under  Linux,  select()  may report a socket file descriptor as "ready for reading", while nevertheless a subsequent read blocks.  This could for example happen when data has arrived but
       upon examination has wrong checksum and is discarded.  There may be other circumstances in which a file descriptor is spuriously reported as ready.  Thus it may be safer  to  use  O_NON‐
       BLOCK on sockets that should not block.

       On  Linux, select() also modifies timeout if the call is interrupted by a signal handler (i.e., the EINTR error return).  This is not permitted by POSIX.1-2001.  The Linux pselect() sys‐
       tem call has the same behavior, but the glibc wrapper hides this behavior by internally copying the timeout to a local variable and passing that variable to the system call.
